 2. Features :
   
       - Create a Mentor: Allows the creation of mentor profiles, storing mentor details.

       - Assign Students to a Mentor: Assigns multiple students to a mentor at once.

       - Change a Studentâ€™s Mentor: Reassigns a mentor to a student while keeping the history of previous assignments.

       - View Students for a Mentor: Shows all students assigned to a mentor.

       - View Previous Mentors of a Student: Logs previous mentors for a particular student.
